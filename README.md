# 🌤️ Simple Weather App

This is a basic Weather App built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a **Weather API**. It was my first ever project, where I explored working with APIs and styling web pages.

## 🚀 Features

- Shows current weather based on user input (city name)
- Fetches live data using an external weather API
- Clean and simple UI using only HTML and CSS
